# Contributing

Thank you for helping. NextTransformer compares architectures under one fixed
[protocol](https://interactive-active-ai.github.io/NextTransformer/docs/protocol/overview/), so every contribution
arrives as a pull request that keeps that protocol intact. The
[documentation](https://interactive-active-ai.github.io/NextTransformer/docs/) has the full guides; this page is the
short version.

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue first** for a new method ([proposal form](https://github.com/Interactive-Active-AI/NextTransformer/issues/new/choose))
   or for any change to shared code. Questions and ideas go to
   [Discussions](https://github.com/Interactive-Active-AI/NextTransformer/discussions).
2. **Fork the repository** and work on a branch of your fork. Keep one method or one result per pull request.
3. **Run the checks locally** (below) and open a pull request into `main`. Maintainers review and merge.

## What a pull request contains

| Contribution | Files | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| A finished formal run | `results/runs/<method>.json` from `export_run`, its audit `evidence/audits/<method>.json` from `audit_run`, a run-notes page, and the tables refreshed by `docs/scripts/generate.py` | [Submit a result](https://interactive-active-ai.github.io/NextTransformer/docs/guides/submit-a-result/) |
| A new method | A plugin `nexttransformer/methods/<method>/`, a calibrated `configs/<family>/<method>.json` and its cost proof under `evidence/costs/`, tests, a model card `results/methods/<method>.json`, and a source-notes entry | [Method plugins](https://interactive-active-ai.github.io/NextTransformer/docs/guides/plugins/) |
| Documentation or the website | Pages under `docs/`, code under `website/` | [Documentation README](docs/README.md), [website README](website/README.md) |
| A change to shared code | Agreed in an issue first; see the guide for the audit it needs | [Changing shared code](https://interactive-active-ai.github.io/NextTransformer/docs/guides/changing-shared-code/) |
| An arena entry | An admission pull request before the formal run, then a result pull request, each with a disclosure card | [Arena rules](https://interactive-active-ai.github.io/NextTransformer/docs/arena/rules/) |

## Local checks

```bash
uv sync --frozen --extra cpu
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES= NANOCHAT_DTYPE=float32 TORCH_COMPILE_DISABLE=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
uv run python -m nexttransformer.checks.changes --base origin/main   # what your change needs
uv run python -m pytest -q -n auto                                   # the same fast suite CI runs
```

CI runs the same commands. Results-only and documentation-only pull requests skip the test suite. Slow tests
(full-size cost-audit reproductions and multi-rank layouts) run with `pytest -m slow`; maintainers trigger them in
CI when a change needs them.

## Rules that keep comparisons fair

- Never change the data, tokenizer, token budget, global batch, schedule, seed or evaluation points for one method.
- A new method changes no shared file; its cost proof covers its own plugin and the shared core.
- Published runs, their audits and cost proofs are never edited; a new version of a method gets a new method id.
- Publish complete formal runs only, with their cumulative audit; record failed attempts in the run notes.
- Keep machine details, local paths and credentials out of the repository. CI's public-content check enforces this.
- Keep code, comments and documentation in English (the Chinese documentation is a translation).
