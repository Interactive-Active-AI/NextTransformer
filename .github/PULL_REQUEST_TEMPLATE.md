## What this changes

<!-- A result, a new method, documentation, or a fix. Link the issue it closes or was agreed in. -->

## Checklist

- [ ] One method or one result per pull request.
- [ ] The training contract is unchanged: data, tokenizer, token budget, batch, schedule, seed and evaluation points.
- [ ] **Result:** audit from `python -m nexttransformer.audit_run` in `evidence/audits/`, record written by `python -m nexttransformer.export_run`, a run-notes page, and tables refreshed with `python docs/scripts/generate.py`.
- [ ] **New method:** plugin under `nexttransformer/methods/<method>/`, calibrated configuration and cost proof, tests, model card, and a source-notes entry.
- [ ] **Shared code:** agreed in an issue first; `python -m nexttransformer.checks.golden --base origin/main` reports no difference, or this pull request explains why one is intended.
- [ ] `python -m pytest -q -n auto` passes locally.
