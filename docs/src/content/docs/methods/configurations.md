title: Configurations
description: Admitted shapes, parameters and audited compute for the documented models and their reference configurations.

Each method in the table has an admitted configuration, `configs/<family>/<method>.json`, and a cost proof in the current
proof set. The table is generated from those files: physical blocks, FFN width, independent parameters, audited training
GFLOPs per input token and the deviation from the SSSL anchor (4.67239832544785). Parameters are outcomes, not controls.

Blocks count physical layers; looped methods reuse them across loops, so their unfolded depth is larger (see the
[source notes](../sources/)). Multi-stage methods weight each stage by its updates: DSA, QSA, Seer and the QSA hybrid run
512 dense burn-in updates before sparse training; Ouro trains its exit gate alone for the final 1,024 updates; Huginn
samples a depth per update from a fixed seed, and its proof enumerates all 46,875 samples.

## Reading a configuration

A configuration holds the model fields (`model`), the protocol it is admitted under (`protocol`, with its fingerprint)
and the calibration record (`calibration`: the audited FLOPs per token and their deviation, the method's source
fingerprint, the PyTorch build of the audit and the path of the cost proof). Configurations are written by
`python -m nexttransformer.protocol.calibrate` and checked by `admit_config`; never edit them by hand.

The historical native track (SSSL, MoR, LoopFormer, Circle Loop) keeps its own configurations under `configs/native/`,
with the historical matrix-FLOPs accounting.
