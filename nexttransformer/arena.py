"""Auto-research arena: disclosure cards, and the files an arena or method pull request may change.

    python -m nexttransformer.arena --check
    python -m nexttransformer.arena --scope origin/main

`--check` validates every card under results/arena/ against the arena rules (docs/src/content/docs/arena/rules.md):
required disclosures, status, involvement
level, selection signal, and the model card, run records, and admitted configuration the entry names. `--scope BASE`
classifies the files changed since BASE when a card is among them or a method plugin is added under
nexttransformer/methods/, and fails when such a pull request changes the training contract, the evaluation, another
method's configuration, or evidence it does not own. Neither imports torch.
